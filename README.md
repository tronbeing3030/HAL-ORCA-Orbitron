# Office Seat Planner
ORCA Optimal office Room Cooperation Application
## Project Overview
Office Seat Planner is a **web-based tool** designed to optimize **seat allocation** across multiple office locations. It helps organizations efficiently **allocate seats**, **reduce real estate costs**, and **monitor power and resource consumption**.

Mainly focussed on problem faced with:  allocating employees for efficient workspace and managing employee allocation and seat into clutter. 
Solution is a visual and real time output with employee allocation and management.

For monitoring the power and other resources, can be done using IOT devices and the data can be analysed using graphs based on monthly data, which gives more insights on cost cutting and resource saving.
## Features
- **Visual Seat Allocation** – Interactive UI for allocating and modifying employee seats.
- **Scalability** – Supports workforce growth up to 3000+ employees.
- **Real-time Tracking** – Provides a live overview of seat occupancy.
- **Cost Optimization** – Identifies underutilized spaces to save rental and operational costs.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-end**: React.js
- **Back-end**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Architecture**: one-to-one, one-to-many relationships & algorithm for seat and employee allocation
